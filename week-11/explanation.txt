I could not get the t-test to work to determine the most statisitically significant differences in gene expression. I am sorry, I tried this repeatedly for weeks and couldn't figure it out. This was the only part of the assignment I couldn't figure out, so I chose a random gene, Uba7, to put into panther to show I know how to use the program. According to this program, the geneI chose is important in protein metabolism and proteolysis, which could have the potential to be important in differentiation as certain proteins will need to be modified or lysed in order to allow for proper differentiation.
